**Description:** This project aims to predict aquifer levels at the Ryan and Eugene Goering Water Technology Farm using a variety of simple models in the R programming language. We aim to provide insights into the factors that contribute to variations in the water level at different geographical locations by exploring a proprietary dataset owned by Viaanix. One objective is to propose innovative solutions for the problem of water level prediction using business
analytics methods. The results from this project could be used to improve understanding of the factors that influence water levels and to make informed decisions about water management at the Ryan and Eugene Goering Water Technology Farm.

**Tools:** R, Python, Microsoft Excel

**Achievement:** First Place, 2023 Analytics and Information Systems Data Science Competition by the Kansas Data Science Consortium
