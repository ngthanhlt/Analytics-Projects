My name is Thanh Tan Nguyen. I have a fascination for data. Spreadsheets and numbers excite me. They deliver stories in a raw and dynamic form, inviting me to uncover and understand.

My data projects range from interactive dashboards to in-depth analyses that meaningfully inform decisions. [Click here](https://github.com/ngthanhlt/Analytics-Projects/wiki/Welcome) to view my projects.

I am eager to hear your thoughts, feedback, and ideas. Feel free to send me inquiries and requests at ngthanh.ttn@gmail.com.
